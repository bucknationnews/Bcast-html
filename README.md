# Bcast-html [DEPRECATED]
This is the HTML files for the locally hosted web server/streaming page. This is built to work with our CVLC based transcoding server, running Ubuntu 14.04, which transcodes video to Theora/OGG so it can be displayed in an HTML5 video tag. This site is the HTML page(s) clients see when they go to our stream link.

### This repository is no longer in use. It has been deprecated in favor of [``streamKit``](https://github.com/bucknationnews/streamKit), which is more capable and will detect network settings automatically.
